<p>A picture is worth a thousand words.</p>

<p>Every time I heard or read this quote I was always looking at photos, trying to see what was in the shot.</p>

<p>It was only after I started taking photos myself and publishing them online that I realized that there was more to this quote.</p>

<p>It is true that the shot captures a point in time that could take you a thousand words to describe. There is something missing though.</p>

<p>It is the planning of the journey and the effort required for the photographer to position themselves in front of that frame, the exact moment to get that shot.</p>

<p>This is not visible to the viewer, but it is a feeling embedded in the shot, that the photograher can recall by looking at their photo.</p>

<p>I tried this assumption with photos I've taken over the years and it is true at least for me.</p>

<p>Here are some examples.</p>

<p>This shot was taken in July 2006 on the Magnificent Mile in downtown Chicago with my OLYMPUS C70Z while I was rushing to get a career fair for IT jobs. It was hot, humid and I was sweating a lot and my feet were hurting because of my leather shoes.</p>

<p><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s<em>!xHNl!,f</em>auto,q<em>auto:good,fl</em>progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e5fca70-5b48-4c37-aac3-c53210f25765_600x300.jpeg"></p>

</a>

<p>I took this photo in Brighton, UK after visiting a supplier for a day seminar. I ended up in the Brighton Pier and was walking around the beach. I remember feeling uneasy because of the long day and the 2-hour drive to get back home to Milton Keynes.</p>

<p><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s<em>!rOCz!,f</em>auto,q<em>auto:good,fl</em>progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa92266e-b7b6-437b-b24b-170060daeaf7_600x300.jpeg"></p>

</a>

<p>**Overcoming Excuses **</p>

<p>Some of the best looking photos, are taken during the Golden Hour. This is a term used by photographers to signify the period when the natural sunlight is amazing. This is an hour before sunset and an hour after sunrise.</p>

<p>Also, the best shots are outside the beaten path.</p>

<p>To get this shot of science world in Vancouver, you have to walk alongside the Cambie bridge and get to the halfway point during the morning golden hour.</p>

<p>Being up at 5:00am on a Sunday to get there at 6:00 am is not something many people would do. I was one of them.</p>

<p><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s<em>!7YLV!,f</em>auto,q<em>auto:good,fl</em>progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50d926e7-568f-4940-b509-768b91795e89_600x300.jpeg"></p>

</a>

<p>Another excuse that stopped me from going out and taking photos in the past, was that I didn't have the right camera.</p>

<p>I was able to overcome this notion, when I was forced to use an iPhone 5c as my only phone and camera at a time that I couldn't afford anything else.</p>

<p>So I started making the best of it.</p>

<p>Milton Keynes, UK - iPhone 5c</p>

<p>Looking at these photos, after 7 years, I still remember where I was physically and emotionally and feels like another lifetime.</p>
