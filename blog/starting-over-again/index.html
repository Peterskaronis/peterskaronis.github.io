<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>Last night I couldn't sleep and somehow I ended up on substack reading a post by Michael Dean, an amazing writer and editor I've worked with and value his input and analysis.</p>

<p>The post was called " <a href="https://www.michaeldean.site/p/substack-or-bust">Substack or Bust</a> ".</p>

<p>Michael managed in 10 minutes to answer all the same arguments I had in my head for a long time.</p>

<p>I went to sleep and the next morning, I started thinking what is the shortest path to transferring my content over to Substack without worrying about anything else.</p>

<p>Another contributing factor was that, over the Christmas period, I realized I hadn't posted anything on my Ghost blog for months.</p>

<p>After reading a blog post by Jason Fried, the creator of Basecamp, explaining how he never set up a personal blog, as it felt too formal, I realized I had similar barriers. I wasn't posting because I was waiting to write something worthy of my blog. Of course, you can't do that If you never write in the first place.</p>

<p>I decided to move my posts over to <a href="https://world.hey.com/">Hey World</a> that is a free blogging service provided as part the hey.com email that I use.</p>

<p>This helped me start writing and publishing again as it is just like writing an email.</p>

<p>There were still some things that bothered me.</p>

<p>There is no custom domain option at the moment so the URL is long and funny to remember <a href="https://world.hey.com/pskaronis">world.hey.com/pskaronis</a> and there is no commenting option. If someone wants to comment, they have to reply back to your post via email or comment on twitter.</p>

<p>I did set up a basic HTML/CSS page on Github Pages that acts as profile page and subscribe form for my Hey World blog and it works fine.</p>

<p>You can check it out <a href="https://skaronis.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>There is no search option, or tags or categories, so after a while you have to go next, next, next page to find something.</p>

<p>Finally, you don't have the cross-promotion that is happening on substack.</p>

<p>My biggest pain is that I am tired of writing in a vacuum.</p>

<p>So, I will start cross-posting on substack as an experiment and review after a few months.</p>

<p>I will keep writing on Hey World as it helps me focus and re-post on Substack. Hey World will also serve as my personal archive and as minimal mirror version of this blog, if you prefer to read posts there.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.skaronis.com/p/coming-soon"></p>

<p>Sometimes, It can get overwhelming trying to read something on substack, especially if you have a lot of subscriptions.</p>

<p>There is a small SEO caveat though with that approach, as substack links will take priority as they don't allow configuring canonical links from other blogs.</p>

<p>So, back to Substack.</p>

<p>Substack allows you to have your own domain for a one-off $50 fee which is nothing compared to paying for Ghost $108/year minimum as Michael mentioned in his post.</p>

<p>The next thing is the design. If you suffer from ADHD like me at times, having too many options makes progress difficult. Luckily, with Substack you get only 3 themes and these are around structure mostly.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I will be transferring my content over to substack and start sending out a weekly newsletter.</p>

<p>I keep track of everything I learn during the week in my Obsidian Second Brain and share the best of what I've learned or connections I made that you might find useful.</p>

<p>See you soon!</p>
