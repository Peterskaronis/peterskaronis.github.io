Today I wandered into a Japanese store in my neighbourhood called ITSUMO which translates to "all the time".

The simplicity of Japanese products, the craftsmanship and level of detail is present in every single item.

The store owner greeted me with, thank you visiting our store and went back behind the counter as I roamed around the store and marvelled at every single item. Everything from cookware to incense and tools used for flower arrangements that I have never seen in my life, where beautifully placed around the store.

Owning a few simple, well build, high quality items brings an unexpected feeling of calm. Aesthetically pleasing items that you want to use every day.

Pencel Japanese pens that feel like you're writing on clouds and bath towels named "marshmallow" made out of 100% premium cotton, that actually feel like you are touching cotton candy.

I've come to understand over the years why Steve Jobs visited Japan multiple times a year.

The feeling of experiencing another perspective to life that does not rely on bigger, better, latest and greatest but rather on minimal creations grounded in mastery and love of the art that stand the test of time.

It's completely the opposite of western civilization where most items don't make it past the first year and end up in garbage yards and subsequently burned or end up at the bottom of the ocean.

I've made conscious decisions over the years to simplify my daily life and invest in quality products that last.

It is not always feasible, but this approach is my antidote to consumerism and leading a less stressful life.
