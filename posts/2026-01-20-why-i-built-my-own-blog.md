  Platforms come and go. Your words should stay.

  ## The Problem

  Every few years, a platform dies or changes its rules:

  - Google Reader shut down
  - Medium paywalled everything
  - Twitter became... whatever it is now

  Your content shouldn't depend on someone else's business model.

  ## The Solution

  A folder of markdown files. That's it.

  No database. No framework. No dependencies that break.

  Just text files that will open in 50 years.
