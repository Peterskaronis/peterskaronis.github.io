This book fundamentally changed how I think about wealth and financial decisions.

## Key Takeaways

- **Wealth is what you don't see** - The cars not purchased, the diamonds not bought. True wealth is the financial assets that haven't yet been converted to stuff.

- **Compounding is magic** - Warren Buffett's skill is investing, but his secret is time. He's been investing for three-quarters of a century.

- **Getting wealthy vs. staying wealthy** - Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. Keeping money requires humility and fear.
